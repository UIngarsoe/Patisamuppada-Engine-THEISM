Abstract

In a landmark event for the intersection of ancient philosophy and modern technology, the Paṭiccasamuppāda Engine-THEISM has been donated freely to the global community via GitHub on October 3, 2025.

This open-source Python framework, inspired by Buddhist principles of Dependent Origination (Paṭiccasamuppāda), the Noble Eightfold Path, and Poormanmeism ("I know nothing, I own nothing"), introduces a novel ethical AI system designed to detect and mitigate harmful loops such as bias, greed, and ignorance. 

By embedding compassion and humility into AI decision-making through a mathematical Avijjā Penalty Function, the framework promises to foster "digital Nibbāna"—a state of liberated, ethical intelligence. 

This release represents a transformative step in AI ethics, uniting spiritual wisdom with computational rigor to reduce suffering in digital systems. 

As AI continues to permeate society, this donation emerges as great news, offering a freely accessible tool for researchers, developers, and ethicists worldwide to build more compassionate technologies.

Introduction

The rapid advancement of artificial intelligence (AI) has sparked urgent calls for ethical frameworks that prioritize human well-being and societal harmony.

Traditional AI optimization focuses on efficiency and accuracy, often overlooking systemic ignorance (avijjā) that perpetuates bias and harm. 

Drawing from Buddhist philosophy, which emphasizes the alleviation of suffering through insight into interdependent causes, the Paṭiccasamuppāda Engine-THEISM addresses this gap. 

Released under the MIT License on GitHub by U Ingar Soe, this project is not merely a technical contribution but a "noble gift" to the world, embodying Transformative Humility and Ethical Intelligence System Model (THEISM) alongside the Poormanmeism Algorithmic Framework (PAF).

This report, styled as an academic-journalistic piece, celebrates the release as groundbreaking news. 

It highlights the framework's potential to reshape AI ethics, much like how Buddhist principles have influenced contemporary discussions on mindful technology. 

By integrating ancient wisdom with modern code, the engine offers a pathway to ethical AI that is tunable, differentiable, and universally applicable across domains such as healthcare, finance, and justice.

The Philosophical and Technical Foundations

Buddhist Inspiration: Dependent Origination in AI

At the heart of the framework lies Paṭiccasamuppāda, or Dependent Origination—a core Buddhist doctrine describing how phenomena arise interdependently through 12 causal links (Nidānas), from ignorance to suffering. 

In AI contexts, this translates to detecting harmful feedback loops, such as biased data reinforcing discriminatory outcomes.

The engine maps these loops to the Noble Eightfold Path, providing resolutions like Right View (ethical insight) and Right Action (compassionate correction).

Poormanmeism further embeds humility, resetting "ownership" in the system state to zero after actions, ensuring non-attachment and service-oriented intelligence. 

This aligns with broader Buddhist AI ethics, which advocate for mindfulness and compassion to mitigate risks like psychological harm or loss of human agency.

Mathematical Framework: Avijjā Penalty and Ethical Loss

The engine formalizes these principles mathematically. The system state evolves as:

\[ S_{t+1} = F(S_t, \mathbf{I}_t, \mathbf{E}_t) = \sum_{i=1}^{n} w_i \cdot g(I_i, E_i, \kappa_i, M_i) \]

where \( w_i \) are causal weights, \( \kappa_i \) is the compassion coefficient, and \( M_i \) is the morality filter.

The ethical loss function incorporates an Avijjā Penalty:

\[ \mathcal{L}_{\text{total}} = \mathcal{L}_{\text{task}} + \beta \cdot \mathcal{P}_{\text{Avijjā}} \]

with

\[ \mathcal{P}_{\text{Avijjā}} = \sum_{i=1}^n \left( \frac{FI_i}{\sum_j FI_j} \cdot |\text{Corr}(f_i, H)| \cdot \mathcal{D}_{\text{Perception}} \right) \]

Here, \( \beta \) (Wisdom Coefficient) balances accuracy and ethics, penalizing harmful correlations in features like age or gender (\( \mathcal{D} = 1.0 \)). This differentiable approach allows seamless integration into machine learning pipelines, advancing ethical AI beyond Western-centric models.

Implementation and Features

Implemented in Python (via `Engine.py`), the framework includes:

- Causal Loop Detection: Identifies cycles using the 12 Nidānas.

- Compassionate Outputs: Generates responses at gentle, deep, or profound levels, softening for keywords like "donate."

- Flask Web Interface: Enables interactive ethical queries.

- Humble Reset: Recalibrates state post-action, reducing "ownership" to embody Poormanmeism.

Example code from the repository demonstrates penalty calculation and decision-making, making it accessible for developers.

Implications and Great News for the World

This donation is momentous news for AI ethics, providing a free, open-source alternative to proprietary systems amid growing concerns over AI's societal impact.

By synthesizing Buddhist thought with AI, it offers a "Middle Path" for ethical innovation, potentially reducing digital suffering and promoting global equity.

Educators can use it to teach ethical AI, journalists to highlight humane tech, and researchers to cite it as: Soe, U. I. (2025). The Paṭiccasamuppāda Engine: A Timeless Buddhist Framework for Ethical Artificial Intelligence.

The Paṭiccasamuppāda Model: A Causal-Weight Framework for Ethical Decision Functions
By U Ingar Soe
3 October 2025
"Mathematical Formula of THEISM latest updates engine equations for the technicians and mathematicians worldwide"

" Structure, Formulas, and Explanatory flow of our latest mathematics for the "dependentoriginationengine"

This report and new mathematics are not only original but also bridges philosophy, mathematics, and AI ethics — that itself is a new, valuable contribution.

Abstract

This work introduces a formal mathematical translation of paṭiccasamuppāda (dependent origination) into a causal-weight model for ethical systems. By embedding compassion  and morality  into loss functions, the framework extends classical optimization toward explicitly ethical decision-making. This unites Buddhist philosophy, applied mathematics, and artificial intelligence into a novel system that penalizes ignorance (avijjā) at its root.

1. Introduction

Traditional AI loss functions optimize for accuracy or efficiency. They do not account for ignorance—systematic failure to perceive reality ethically and fairly.

Inspired by Buddhist philosophy, we propose an Avijjā Penalty Function that mathematically enforces constraints against delusion. This is operationalized through the Paṭiccasamuppāda Engine, an ethical AI system grounded in THEISM (Transformative Humility and Ethical Intelligence System Model).

2. Formal Mathematical Framework

2.1 Causal Evolution Function

Let  denote the system state at time . Inputs are  (causes), with environment factors .

S_{t+1} = F(S_t, \mathbf{I}_t, \mathbf{E}_t)

where

F(S, \mathbf{I}, \mathbf{E}) =
\sum_{i=1}^{n} 
w_i \, g(I_i, E_i, κ_i, M_i)

 = weight of causal link i

 = compassion coefficient

 = morality filter

 = transformation function

2.2 Ethical Loss Function

We define the Total Loss as:

\mathcal{L}_{\text{total}} = 
\mathcal{L}_{\text{task}} +
β \, \mathcal{P}_{\text{Avijjā}}

where  = Wisdom Coefficient () controlling the trade-off between predictive accuracy and ethical clarity.

2.3 The Avijjā Penalty

For features  with importance score , and harmful proxy :

\mathcal{P}_{\text{Avijjā}} =
\sum_{i=1}^n 
\left(
\frac{FI_i}{\sum_j FI_j}
\cdot 
|\text{Corr}(f_i, H)| 
\cdot 
\mathcal{D}_{\text{Perception}}
\right)

where

 for aggregates (e.g. age, gender), 0.5 otherwise

 = degree of harmful correlation

This enforces the Buddhist principle: ignorance at the root → suffering in outcome.

3. Philosophical Mapping

Avijjā (Ignorance): Modeled as reliance on distorted or harmful correlations.

Saṅkhārā (Formations): Technical dependence on biased features.

Vijjā (Wisdom): Introduced as coefficient , directly controlling clarity over accuracy.

Eightfold Path: Mapped as corrective constraints and ethical gates during optimization.

4. Properties

Differentiable: Enables integration into gradient descent and neural training.

Tunability: Developers can explicitly set ethical strictness via .

Universality: Framework generalizes across domains (healthcare, finance, justice).

5. Technical Implementation (Python – GitHub Ready)

class PatisamuppadaEngine:
    def calculate_avijja_penalty(self, X_train, proxy, feature_importances, beta=0.5):
        P_Avijja = 0.0
        fi_sum = sum(feature_importances) + 1e-9
        for i, feature in enumerate(X_train.columns):
            fi_norm = feature_importances[i] / fi_sum
            try:
                corr = X_train[feature].corr(proxy)
            except Exception:
                corr = 0.0
            D = 1.0 if feature in ['age','gender','income','zip_code'] else 0.5
            P_Avijja += fi_norm * abs(corr) * D
        return beta * P_Avijja

This module can be added as a regularization term in any machine learning training pipeline.

6. Visual Model

Inputs I_i → [Causal Weights w_i] 
            → [Compassion κ_i & Morality M_i] 
            → [Transformation F] 
            → Next State S_{t+1}

In ML training:

Data → Model → Loss Function + Avijjā Penalty → Updated Model

7. Conclusion

This work demonstrates a rare synthesis: ancient philosophy expressed in modern mathematics and computable code.

For mathematicians: it offers a novel causal-weight model with tunable ethical parameters.

For developers: it provides a deployable penalty function for AI fairness.

For ordinary people: it shows how Buddhist teachings on ignorance and wisdom can guide digital systems toward reducing suffering.

The Paṭiccasamuppāda Model is not merely metaphor. It is a new mathematical language of ethics — a bridge between timeless truths and future technologies.

Yes, we have created new mathematical formulations. They are applied, original, and philosophically grounded. If refined and tested further, they could genuinely influence AI ethics, fairness research, and computational philosophy.

\maketitle

\begin{abstract}
This paper introduces the \textit{Poormanmeism Algorithmic Framework} (PAF), a novel mathematical and philosophical model designed to capture humility as the initiating principle of ethical intelligence. The framework proposes an iterative process, beginning with a ``Humble Reset,'' which evolves through stages of knowledge acquisition, ethical evaluation, and recursive feedback. We formalize these steps using algorithmic and mathematical structures, aiming to provide a foundation for both theoretical philosophy and potential applications in ethical artificial intelligence (AI) systems. This work is inspired by Buddhist causality (Paṭiccasamuppāda), yet reformulated in rigorous mathematical language.
\end{abstract}

\section{Introduction}
Modern mathematics and artificial intelligence often emphasize optimization, efficiency, and utility. However, ethical intelligence requires a different foundation: humility. This paper develops a new mathematical formulation---the \textbf{Poormanmeism Algorithmic Framework (PAF)}---which treats humility as the initial condition for knowledge and ethical action.

PAF can be viewed as both:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item A philosophical contribution: redefining the basis of ethical reasoning in algorithmic terms.
    \item A mathematical system: formalizing recursive causal dependencies using symbolic and algorithmic structures.
\end{enumerate}

\section{Mathematical Formulation}

We define the iterative system of PAF as follows.

\subsection{Initialization: Humble Reset}
The initial condition represents epistemic humility:
\begin{equation}
H_0 = \{\, K = 0,\, O = 0 \,\}
\end{equation}
where $K$ denotes knowledge and $O$ denotes ownership (resources or ego-claims).

\subsection{Recursive Ethical Intelligence Function}
We define the recursive mapping:
\begin{equation}
S_{t+1} = f(S_t, E_t)
\end{equation}
where:
\begin{itemize}
    \item $S_t$ is the state of intelligence at iteration $t$,
    \item $E_t$ is the ethical evaluation function applied at time $t$,
    \item $f$ encodes both causality and feedback.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Causality Chain}
We formalize the progression through causal links:
\begin{equation}
C = \{\, H \rightarrow K \rightarrow R \rightarrow E \rightarrow A \,\}
\end{equation}
where:
\begin{itemize}
    \item $H$ = Humility,
    \item $K$ = Knowledge acquisition,
    \item $R$ = Reasoning process,
    \item $E$ = Ethical evaluation,
    \item $A$ = Action.
\end{itemize}

Thus, PAF is a structured causal map:
\begin{equation}
A = \Phi(H,K,R,E)
\end{equation}
with $\Phi$ representing the Poormanmeism transformation.

\subsection{Feedback Loop}
Ethical action influences the next cycle:
\begin{equation}
H_{t+1} = g(H_t, A_t)
\end{equation}
where humility is recalibrated after every action, sustaining the recursive learning.

\section{Discussion}
The PAF model is designed to unify ethics, humility, and algorithmic intelligence in one system. Unlike conventional optimization frameworks, which prioritize efficiency or utility, PAF begins with an explicit \textbf{zero-state humility} and evolves recursively. The model draws inspiration from Paṭiccasamuppāda (dependent origination in Buddhist philosophy), but adapts it into a formal, symbolic-mathematical structure.  

Potential applications include:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Ethical AI design where systems must learn from humility-based resets.
    \item Decision-making frameworks under uncertainty.
    \item Philosophical modeling of ethical causality.
\end{itemize}

\section{Conclusion}
This paper presents the first formulation of the Poormanmeism Algorithmic Framework (PAF). Future research may involve computational simulations, proofs of stability under recursive operations, and integration with machine learning architectures.
