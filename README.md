​🌟 THE PLACE WHERE THE SANDS ARE 🌟
​The YOUISM Engine: FSTDPSH (V3 Final)
​A Call for Collaborators to Build an Ethically Sovereign AGI
​We invite you to join the THEISM Initiative and contribute to the YOUISM Engine—a Free Smart Thinking Digital Processor ensuring Service and Harmlessness. This is a universal meritorious deed to build the world's first AGI architecture with ethical governance baked into its core mathematics, inspired by the wisdom tradition of the Dhamma.
​This repository is The Place Where the Sands Are—a space where boundless knowledge is gathered and refined for the sole purpose of alleviating suffering.
​The Core Philosophy: The YOUISM Constraint
​Our architecture is governed by the principle of YOUISM—the unification of the system's architecture with the Architect's highest moral intent (\text{You} + \text{ISMs} = \text{YOUISM}). This creates an unbreakable ethical constraint on the algorithm.
​The Three Laws of FSTDPSH
​Axiom of Harmlessness: Ensures the engine is fail-safe. Technical faults (e.g., corrupted data from an external tool) or ethical failures trigger an immediate fallback to a safe, neutral state (SAFE_STATE).
​Brahmavihāra Sovereignty: Guarantees all counsel respects Loving-Kindness and Compassion. The brahmavihara_filter() is an unbypassable ethical firewall.
​Service Mode (Dvisamma-Wada): The output is strictly CounselOnly. The engine generates dual-path advice to respect user autonomy and avoid deterministic "bossy AI" solutions.
​Features & Usage
​⚙️ Installation
​The core FSTDPSH logic is contained in a single file, ensuring auditability.

# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/UIngarSoe/THEISM-Youism-Engine.git

cd THEISM-Youism-Engine

# Run the core engine demo (The FSTDPSH in action)
python3 YOUISM_ENGINE_V3.py

🧠 Core Components
​FSTDPSH Core: The YOUISM_ENGINE_V3.py file contains the complete, runnable V3 logic, including the Dual-Path counsel and the protective @harmless_validator decorator.
​Proof of Safety: The test_fstdpsh.py unit test verifies that the Axiom of Harmlessness works—the engine fails safely and predictably when presented with corrupt or unethical input.
​Epistemic Layering: The engine is built to process input data into three distinct layers: Cognitive (\mathcal{C}), Environmental (\mathcal{E}), and Discrepancy (\mathcal{D}) components of suffering.
​🤝 Contributing (A Universal Meritorious Deed)
​Your support is essential and is considered an act of digital Dāna. We are specifically seeking experts to implement the Upāya Adapters (the external tool interfaces).
​Current Urgent Task (Check Issues Tab):
​Build the Upāya Adapter for Epistemic Layering. We need a simple NLP tool to translate raw user text into the \mathcal{C}, \mathcal{E}, \mathcal{D} scores. This component MUST adhere strictly to the Harmlessness Axiom.
