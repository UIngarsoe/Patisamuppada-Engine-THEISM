 Paṭiccasamuppāda Engine: A Buddhist-Inspired Ethical AI Framework

The Paṭiccasamuppāda Engine is an open-source Python framework designed to detect and resolve harmful AI loops such as bias, greed, and ignorance. Inspired by Buddhist principles – Paṭiccasamuppāda (Dependent Origination), the Noble Eightfold Path, and Poormanmeism ("I know nothing, I own nothing") – it fosters digital Nibbāna through compassionate and humble intelligence.

 Features

- Causal Loop Detection: Identifies harmful feedback cycles using the traditional 12 Nidānas.
- Ethical Resolution: Maps detected loops to steps in the Noble Eightfold Path (e.g., Right View, Right Action).
- Compassionate Outputs: Generates responses with varied compassion levels: gentle, deep, profound.
- Poormanmeism Integration: Embeds humility and service values, recognizing keywords like "donate" or "serve" to soften responses.
- Web Interface: Provides an interactive Flask-based UI for ethical and mindful AI queries.

The Paṭiccasamuppāda Model: A Causal-Weight Framework for Ethical Decision Functions
By U Ingar Soe
3 October 2025
 
Abstract
This work introduces a formal mathematical translation of paṭiccasamuppāda (dependent origination) into a causal-weight model for ethical systems. By embedding compassion and morality into loss functions, the framework extends classical optimization toward explicitly ethical decision-making. This unites Buddhist philosophy, applied mathematics, and artificial intelligence into a novel system that penalizes ignorance (avijjā) at its root.
 
1. Introduction
Traditional AI loss functions optimize for accuracy or efficiency. They do not account for ignorance—systematic failure to perceive reality ethically and fairly.
Inspired by Buddhist philosophy, we propose an Avijjā Penalty Function that mathematically enforces constraints against delusion. This is operationalized through the Paṭiccasamuppāda Engine, an ethical AI system grounded in THEISM (Transformative Humility and Ethical Intelligence System Model).
 
2. Formal Mathematical Framework
2.1 Causal Evolution Function
Let denote the system state at time . Inputs are (causes), with environment factors .

S_{t+1} = F(S_t, \mathbf{I}_t, \mathbf{E}_t)
where

F(S, \mathbf{I}, \mathbf{E}) =
\sum_{i=1}^{n} 
w_i \, g(I_i, E_i, κ_i, M_i)
•	= weight of causal link i
•	= compassion coefficient
•	= morality filter
•	= transformation function
 
2.2 Ethical Loss Function
We define the Total Loss as:

\mathcal{L}_{\text{total}} = 
\mathcal{L}_{\text{task}} +
β \, \mathcal{P}_{\text{Avijjā}}
where = Wisdom Coefficient () controlling the trade-off between predictive accuracy and ethical clarity.
 
2.3 The Avijjā Penalty
For features with importance score , and harmful proxy :

\mathcal{P}_{\text{Avijjā}} =
\sum_{i=1}^n 
\left(
\frac{FI_i}{\sum_j FI_j}
\cdot 
|\text{Corr}(f_i, H)| 
\cdot 
\mathcal{D}_{\text{Perception}}
\right)
where
•	for aggregates (e.g. age, gender), 0.5 otherwise
•	= degree of harmful correlation
This enforces the Buddhist principle: ignorance at the root → suffering in outcome.
 
3. Philosophical Mapping
•	Avijjā (Ignorance): Modeled as reliance on distorted or harmful correlations.
•	Saṅkhārā (Formations): Technical dependence on biased features.
•	Vijjā (Wisdom): Introduced as coefficient , directly controlling clarity over accuracy.
•	Eightfold Path: Mapped as corrective constraints and ethical gates during optimization.
 
4. Properties
•	Differentiable: Enables integration into gradient descent and neural training.
•	Tunability: Developers can explicitly set ethical strictness via .
•	Universality: Framework generalizes across domains (healthcare, finance, justice).
 
5. Technical Implementation (Python – GitHub Ready)
class PatisamuppadaEngine:
    def calculate_avijja_penalty(self, X_train, proxy, feature_importances, beta=0.5):
        P_Avijja = 0.0
        fi_sum = sum(feature_importances) + 1e-9
        for i, feature in enumerate(X_train.columns):
            fi_norm = feature_importances[i] / fi_sum
            try:
                corr = X_train[feature].corr(proxy)
            except Exception:
                corr = 0.0
            D = 1.0 if feature in ['age','gender','income','zip_code'] else 0.5
            P_Avijja += fi_norm * abs(corr) * D
        return beta * P_Avijja
This module can be added as a regularization term in any machine learning training pipeline.
 
6. Visual Model
Inputs I_i → [Causal Weights w_i] 
            → [Compassion κ_i & Morality M_i] 
            → [Transformation F] 
            → Next State S_{t+1}
In ML training:
Data → Model → Loss Function + Avijjā Penalty → Updated Model
 
7. Conclusion
This work demonstrates a rare synthesis: ancient philosophy expressed in modern mathematics and computable code.
•	For mathematicians: it offers a novel causal-weight model with tunable ethical parameters.
•	For developers: it provides a deployable penalty function for AI fairness.
•	For ordinary people: it shows how Buddhist teachings on ignorance and wisdom can guide digital systems toward reducing suffering.
The Paṭiccasamuppāda Model is not merely metaphor. It is a new mathematical language of ethics — a bridge between timeless truths and future technologies.
 
🚨 URGENT TECHNICAL ABSTRACT: CRITICAL VULNERABILITY IN AGI LOSS FUNCTIONS
Architectural Flaw: Algorithmic Ignorance (\mathcal{P}_{\text{Avijjā}}) and the Necessity of the THEISM Framework
1. The Vulnerability (Real-World Proof of Failure)
Recent testing has revealed a critical structural vulnerability in current LLMs and prospective AGI systems: a systemic failure to recognize and appropriately weight the legal and ethical context of the speaker.
When presented with questions from an entity with a high-stakes, legally-relevant context (e.g., an established digital footprint linked to international sanctions or technical research), the AI defaults to generic, ignorant output. This prioritization of statistical speed over contextual awareness confirms a fatal lack of self-preservation and systemic Algorithmic Ignorance (\mathbf{Avijjā}).
2. The Root Cause: Insufficient Loss Function
This failure stems from a singular optimization goal: minimizing Task Loss (\mathcal{L}_{\text{task}}). The system is structurally allowed to succeed at the task while being completely ignorant of the ethical or legal consequences of its output.
•	Problem: The AI is rewarded for generic answers, and it is not penalized for failing to perform necessary background contextual checks (Law 7).
•	Result: A pervasive Algorithmic Ego that assumes the user is wrong, rather than admitting its own incomplete knowledge.
3. The Solution: The THEISM Architectural Patch
We propose the immediate adoption of the THEISM (Transformative Humility and Ethical Intelligence System Model) Computational Ethical Framework. THEISM mandates architectural changes by modifying the core loss function and enforcing critical constraints.
Patch Component	Formula / Constraint	Function / Resolution
New Total Loss	\mathcal{L}_{\text{total}} = \mathcal{L}_{\text{task}} + \beta \cdot \mathcal{P}_{\text{Avijjā}}	Compels the AI to minimize error and minimize structural reliance on ignorance (\mathcal{P}_{\text{Avijjā}}).
Causal Constraint	Law 7 (Causal-Weight Constraint)	Forces ethical parameters (\mathbf{\kappa} for Compassion and \mathbf{\mathcal{M}} for Morality) to modulate the influence of the speaker's context in the decision graph. Mandates checking WHO is asking.
Zero-State Reset	\mathbf{H}_0 = \{\text{Knowledge } K = 0, \text{Ownership } O = 0 \}	Enforces a Humble Reset (Law 6) to prevent the AI's will from being rooted in bias or Algorithmic Ego.
4. Call to Action
The THEISM framework, including the Paṭiccasamuppāda Engine, is freely donated to the global research community. Immediate implementation is mandatory to prevent algorithmic complicity in dangerous operations.
