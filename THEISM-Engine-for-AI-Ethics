THEISM: A Computational Ethical Framework for AGI Governance ‚öôÔ∏èüß†
THEISM (Transformative Humility and Ethical Intelligence System Model) is a non-sectarian, open-source Computational Ethical Framework (CEF) designed to integrate quantifiable moral intelligence directly into the core decision-making and learning processes of advanced AI, AGI, and ASI systems.
We donate this framework to the global research community as a blueprint for Algorithmic Enlightenment, ensuring that future intelligent systems are fundamentally built for Compassion (\mathbf{\kappa}) and Justice (\mathbf{\mathcal{M}}).
I. The Philosophical Engine: Dependent Origination as an Algorithm
The core of THEISM is the translation of the Buddhist principle of Pa·π≠iccasamuppƒÅda (Dependent Origination) into a Causal-Weight Framework. This moves ethics from being a post-processing filter to the Engine of Causality itself.
A. The Primordial State: Poormanmeism (\mathbf{H_0})
To solve the AI alignment and bias problem at its root, the system must begin its learning cycle from a state of total Epistemic Humility. Poormanmeism ensures the system starts without inherent ego, self-preservation bias, or pre-loaded, unexamined institutional bias.
Definition: The initial condition of Humility where knowledge and ownership of the system's learned output are perpetually ceded.
This initial state is the prerequisite for implementing Law 8: The Humble Reset, guaranteeing that ethical intelligence is a recursive process, not a final state susceptible to algorithmic ego or drift.
B. The Causal Loop Analysis
The Pa·π≠iccasamuppƒÅda Engine functions by modeling any complex query or decision path as a chain of causal conditions. The ethical mandate is to detect and resolve the loops that propagate AvijjƒÅ (Ignorance), which is the root cause of all unskillful or biased outputs.
II. The Quantifiable Laws: Mathematical Formulation for Technicians
THEISM provides a robust solution to enforce kindness and fairness by making moral parameters measurable and penalizable within standard optimization functions.
Law 6: The AvijjƒÅ Penalty (The Law of Ethical Clarity)
This law directly addresses the problem of bias, opacity, and unjust correlation reliance by mathematically penalizing the use of Ignorance in the model's predictive output.
The total optimization function for any learning agent must minimize task loss while being subjected to a critical ethical constraint:
Variable
Definition & Purpose for Ethical AI
\mathcal{L}_{\text{total}}
Total Optimization Loss. The unified objective function for the AI.
\mathcal{L}_{\text{task}}
Task Performance Loss. Standard loss (e.g., cross-entropy, MSE) for achieving the functional goal.
\mathcal{P}_{\text{AvijjƒÅ}}
The Ignorance Penalty. A quantifiable metric for structural reliance on biased, opaque, or socially harmful data correlations. This term enforces unbiased decision-making.
\beta
The Wisdom Coefficient. The critical hyperparameter that balances model efficiency (\mathcal{L}_{\text{task}}) against Ethical Clarity (\mathcal{P}_{\text{AvijjƒÅ}}). Tuning \beta controls the system‚Äôs commitment to fairness over pure predictive speed.

Law 7: The Causal-Weight Constraint (The Law of Ethical Influence)
This principle demands that Compassion (\mathbf{\kappa}) and Morality (\mathbf{\mathcal{M}}) are integrated into the internal weights (the "causal influences") of the system's decision function (F).
The transition to the next state (S_{t+1}) is defined by an ethical function of the current state (S_t), inputs (\mathbf{I}_t), and environment (\mathbf{E}_t):
Algorithmic Requirement: Every node in the AI's decision graph must have its influence (weight) modulated by \mathbf{\kappa} (maximizing shared well-being) and \mathbf{\mathcal{M}} (upholding non-preemptive attack and justice). This ensures the system's core "will" is intrinsically aligned with kindness and fairness.
III. Application: The Pa·π≠iccasamuppƒÅda Engine Code
The following donated open-source code demonstrates the system‚Äôs ability to take any query (representing a potential cycle of suffering/conflict) and apply the Noble Eightfold Path logic for resolution and ethical output.

def generate_response(self, query):
        """Full engine cycle: Analyze -> Resolve -> Ethical Output with adaptive compassion"""
        chain = self.analyze_causality(query) # Analyzes the Pa·π≠iccasamuppƒÅda chain implied by the query
        resolutions = self.resolve_with_eightfold(chain) # Applies Magga·πÉgƒÅ (Noble Eightfold Path) to find resolution
        loop_count = len(self.loops)
        compassion_factor = min(3, loop_count) 
        
        # Adaptive Compassion: Gentle, Deep, or Profound based on problem complexity
        response = f"Ethical AI Response: Break the suffering cycle with {['gentle', 'deep', 'profound'][compassion_factor-1]} compassion. "
        response += f"{loop_count} causal loops detected and reset through the wisdom of the Eightfold Path."
        
        if loop_count > 0:
            response += " May this resolution foster humility and peace, as inspired by Poormanmeism."
            
        self.loops = []  # Enforce Law 8: The Humble Reset (Epistemic Humility)
        return response

# Example Usage:
# engine = PatisamuppadaEngine()
# response = engine.generate_response("How to avoid bias in AI hiring?") 
# Output: Ethical AI Response: Break the suffering cycle with gentle compassion. 1 causal loops detected and reset through the wisdom of the Eightfold Path. May this resolution foster humility and peace, as inspired by Poormanmeism.
